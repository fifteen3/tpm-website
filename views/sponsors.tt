    The Toronto Perl Mongers does not collect membership dues.
    We are, thus, dependant on &quot;the kindness of
    strangers&quot;; OK, not &quot;strangers&quot;, but 
    the contributions are from many sources, including the following:

            First and foremost, we are indebted to several people within
            our own membership. Largely private contributions enable us to
            host out-of-town guest speakers.
