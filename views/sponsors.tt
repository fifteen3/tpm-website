        The Toronto Perl Mongers does not collect membership dues.
        We are, thus, dependant on &quot;the kindness of
        strangers&quot;; OK, not &quot;strangers&quot;, but 
        the contributions are from many sources, including the following:

              First and foremost, we are indebted to several people within
              our own membership. Largely private contributions enable us to
              host out-of-town guest speakers.
