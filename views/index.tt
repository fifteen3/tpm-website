<p>The Toronto Perl Mongers is a group of Perl programmers and hackers of all levels who get together to talk about Perl. Perl is a programming language which can be used for a large variety of tasks. A typical simple use of Perl would be for extracting information from a text file and printing out a report or for converting a text file into another form. But Perl provides a large number of tools for quite complicated problems, including systems programming and scientific research.</p>
