    <synopsis>
      <p>We have an old web app running using Apache, Perl and Mysql on 
      Windows - the development server. We have a client that can't always get 
      internet access in meetings and is hoping we can find a way to "bundle" 
      the app for easy install on local computers. Setting the app up takes 
      a few minutes - install Perl, install the modules, install mysql, 
      install Apache, configure the local server. Is there some way to send
      a DVD to someone so they can click and install?</p>
