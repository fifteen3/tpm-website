	<a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com">Phillip Smith</a>
	will give quick (30 min or so) introduction to <a
	href="http://bricolagecms.org/">Bricolage</a> - what it is,
	what it isn't, its main components, and a couple of scenarios
	where Bricolage is a good option.  There will be time for
	Q &amp; A and discussion after the talk.
