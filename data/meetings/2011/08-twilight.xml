&quot;You unlock this door with the key of a hash. Beyond it is another
dimension—a dimension of strange constructs, a dimension of improbable
behaviour. You're moving into a land of both weird syntax and unlikely
semantics, of unintended features and unexpected beauty. You've just crossed
over into...The Twilight Perl.&quot;
      </p>
	<p>
Join Damian for a head-trip through a dozen or so arcane and sinister
“features” of Perl. Much of what you thought was required...isn’t; some of
what you thought was impossible...is easy. Cast off your strictures and
warnings and set your programs free. Embrace the Dark Side of the Code. You
have nothing to lose—except your sanity!
