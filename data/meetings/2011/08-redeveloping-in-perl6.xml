    <title>(Re)Developing in Perl 6</title>
    <description>
      <p>
	      Now that Perl 6 is available in a usable form &lt;<a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">http://www.rakudo.org/</a>&gt;, over
the past twelve months Damian has revisited some of his most popular Perl 5
modules and reimplemented them in "native" Perl 6.
      <p>
      </p>
In this talk he will walk through the changes needed to port several of
those modules, a journey that gives a surprisingly thorough overview of how
the two languages differ, as well as insights into the relative strengths of
each.
