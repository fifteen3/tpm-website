      <p>
        This month's topic is Perl and work.  Perl we know and love, and
        there are many ways we can use it for &#8220;work&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meeting is a moderated discussion about Perl and its
        interaction with work, Perl coders looking for and applying
        for jobs, people working for orgainzations looking for Perl
        coders, Perl people looking at complementary technologies
        which help get a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some a job is a regular salaried &#8220;9 to 5&#8221;
        affair with defined benefits and vacation; for others it's
        consulting and the risks and rewards of finding customers
        and building relationships. For some people &#8220;work&#8221; might
        not even come into contact with Perl at all.  How does
        someone know what they want from a job?
      </p>
      <p>
        What are good interview techniques from the perspective of interviewers and 
        interviewees?  What interview war stories do people have - from either side
        of the divide?
      </p>
      <p>
        What are the surprises and dissappointments from jobs people have had in the
        Toronto area?  What do you really want from a job?
      </p>
      <p>
	After the meeting we will go to
	<a href="http://thespotteddickpub.com/">the Spotted Dick</a>
	at 81 Bloor Street East.
